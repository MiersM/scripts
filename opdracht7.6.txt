7.6. Practice : enhanced scripts
Give each script a different name (e.g. the chapter + exercise number), keep them
for later!
1. Write a script that receives four parameters, and outputs them in reverse order.
2. Write a script that print the numbers 1 to 50 on your screen.
3. Write a script that counts the number of files ending in .txt in the current directory.
4. Write a script which prints your name on the screen, every 3 seconds, until ctrl
+C is pressed.
5. Change the script, so that the printed name can be passed as a first parameter of
the script.
6. Write a script that counts from 3 to 7 and then from 7 to 3, and all this three times,
once with a for loop, once with a while loop and once with a until loop.
7. Write a script that receives two parameters (two filenames) and outputs whether
those files exist.
8. Improve the script from the previous question. to complain if it does not receive
exactly two parameters.
9. Write a script to test that an ipnut number is between 1 and 100, exit with an error
if it is not so.
10. Change the script of question 5, so that it checks if there is a name passed in a
parameter. If not, print your own name by default.
